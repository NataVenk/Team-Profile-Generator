## Goal

create generator that enables to enter team members on my team

## Acceptance Criteria
When I open the application I am presented with options to enter Manager, Engineer and Intern. Once i click on each option - I'm asked to provide information as following:

Manager: 
Name, Role, email, Office

Engineer:
Name, Role, email, github

Intern: 
Name, Role, email, school


When I click on email - my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

When I click on GitHub - GitHub profile opens in a new tab

When I'm finished building my team I can exit the application, and the HTML is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
